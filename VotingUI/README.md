This is the front end UI that will be visible to all users able to take part in votes.

###TO DO:
* Make the website functional by adding javascript (currently, it's purely html+css).
* Make the voting page more responsive: 
    - when the size of the window is below 700, either make the `selectionarea` become accesible by scrolling to the left, or move it below/above the `votingarea`.
    - When the log out button moves below the reddit one, change its `float:right` to `float:left`.
* Change the `hover` and `active` color animations of buttons: Currently, the contrast augments, but it's pretty ugly.
